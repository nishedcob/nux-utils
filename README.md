# New \*niX (NUX) Binaries

This project has been in the making a long time, ever since I started writing my own Shell One-Line Idioms. This repository is a collection of those Idioms. Pull-requests are welcome, one utility per commit; I am not an expert in Shell scripting, improvements would be lovely.
